# AP Exam Score Distributions
Some students have been complaining that certain AP exams are getting more difficult each year.   As a private tutor for the AP Stats exam and someone with a Master's in Stats, I'm interested to see what the data can show me. 

## Data

The data was pulled from [Total Registration](https://www.totalregistration.net/AP-Exam-Registration-Service/AP-Exam-Score-Distributions.php).
The data includes:

* Exam: the different AP Exam names (ie. Statistics, French Language, Chemistry, etc.)
* 5, 4, 3, 2, 1:  The percentage of students who recieved this score
* Pass: The percentage of students who passed the AP exam or recieved a 3 or higher
* Date Tweeted
* Year


## Rough plan:
1.  Gather data
2.  Clean data/make transformations (mean score) 
4.  Descriptive Statistics
5.  Plots/Graphs
6.  Model?

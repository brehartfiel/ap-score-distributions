# AP Exam Score Distributions
Some students have been complaining that certain AP exams are getting more difficult each year.   As a private tutor for the AP Stats exam and someone with a Master's in Stats, I'm interested to see what the data can show me. 


## Data

The data was pulled from [Total Registration](https://www.totalregistration.net/AP-Exam-Registration-Service/AP-Exam-Score-Distributions.php).
The data includes:

<ul style=â€œlist-style-type: circle>
<li>Exam: the different AP Exam names (ie. Statistics, French Language, Chemistry, etc.)
<li>5, 4, 3, 2, 1:  The percentage of students who recieved this score
<li>Pass: The percentage of students who passed the AP exam or recieved a 3 or higher
<li>Date Tweeted
<li>Year
</ol>

## Rough plan:

1.  Gather data
2.  Clean data/make transformations
     a. Calculate a mean score 
3.  Descriptive Statistics
4.  Plots/Graphs
5.  Model?
